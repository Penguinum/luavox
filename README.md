# Luavox

## What?
Binding generator for [SunVox library](https://www.warmplace.ru/soft/sunvox/sunvox_lib.php) and the binding itself.

## Why?
Wanna use SunVox library in Lua (probably in some love2d game). It's awesome, allows you doing dynamic/generative music and cool stuff like that.

## Okay, how do I use it?
You can't. Yet.

## License?
The SunVox library itself is proprietary, but it seems MIT will work for the binding. TODO yet though, still unsure.
